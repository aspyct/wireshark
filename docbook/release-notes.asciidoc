This is an experimental release intended to test new features for
Wireshark 3.0.

== What is Wireshark?

Wireshark is the world’s most popular network protocol analyzer. It is
used for troubleshooting, analysis, development and education.

(wsbuglink:1419[])

=== New and Updated Features

The following features are new (or have been significantly updated)
since version 2.9.0:

* Nothing yet.

The following features are new (or have been significantly updated)
since version 2.6.0:

* The Windows .exe installers now ship with Npcap instead of WinPcap.
* Conversation timestamps are supported for UDP/UDP-Lite protocols
* TShark now supports the `-G elastic-mapping` option which generates an ElasticSearch mapping file.
* The “Capture Information” dialog has been added back (wsbuglink:12004[]).
* The Ethernet and IEEE 802.11 dissectors no longer validate the frame check sequence (checksum) by default.
* The TCP dissector gained a new “Reassemble out-of-order segments” preference
  to fix dissection and decryption issues in case TCP segments are received
  out-of-order. See the User’s Guide, chapter _TCP Reassembly_ for details.
* Decryption support for the new WireGuard dissector (wsbuglink:15011[], requires Libgcrypt 1.8).
* The BOOTP dissector has been renamed to DHCP. With the exception of
  “bootp.dhcp”, the old “bootp.*” display filter fields are still supported
  but may be removed in a future release.
* The SSL dissector has been renamed to TLS. As with BOOTP the old
  “ssl.*” display filter fields are supported but may be removed in a
  future release.
* Coloring rules, IO graphs, Filter Buttons and protocol preference tables
  can now be copied from other profiles using a button in the corresponding
  configuration dialogs.
* APT-X has been renamed to aptX.
* When importing from hex dump, it's now possible to add an ExportPDU header with a payload name. This
  calls the specific dissector directly without lower protocols.
* The sshdump and ciscodump extcap interfaces can now use a proxy for the SSH connection.
* Dumpcap now supports the `-a packets:NUM` and `-b packets:NUM` options.
* Wireshark now includes a “No Reassembly” configuration profile.
* Wireshark now supports the Russian language.
* The build system now supports AppImage packages.
* The Windows installers now ship with Qt 5.12.0. Previously they
  shipped with Qt 5.9.7.

=== Removed Features and Support

* The legacy (GTK+) user interface has been removed and is no longer supported.
* Wireshark requires Qt 5.2 or later. Qt 4 is no longer supported.
* Wireshark requires GLib 2.32 or later.
* Building Wireshark requires CMake. Autotools is no longer supported.
* TShark’s `-z compare` option was removed.

== Getting Wireshark

Wireshark source code and installation packages are available from
https://www.wireshark.org/download.html.

=== Vendor-supplied Packages

Most Linux and Unix vendors supply their own Wireshark packages. You can
usually install or upgrade Wireshark using the package management system
specific to that platform. A list of third-party packages can be found
on the https://www.wireshark.org/download.html#thirdparty[download page]
on the Wireshark web site.

== File Locations

Wireshark and TShark look in several different locations for preference
files, plugins, SNMP MIBS, and RADIUS dictionaries. These locations vary
from platform to platform. You can use About→Folders to find the default
locations on your system.

== Getting Help

The User’s Guide, manual pages and various other documentation can be
found at https://www.wireshark.org/docs/

Community support is available on https://ask.wireshark.org/[Wireshark’s
Q&A site] and on the wireshark-users mailing list. Subscription
